Introduction:
The website allows users to explore historical events  that happened on a specific date. Users can select a date from a date picker, and the website will display notable events, births, deaths, 
or anniversaries that occurred on that day throughout history.

How It Works:
1.When a user selects a date, the JavaScript function (fetchHistory) processes the input and displays the corresponding historical events.
2.The historical events are currently hardcoded for specific dates (e.g., "October 10th"), but this can be replaced with an API for more dynamic, real-time data.
3.If no events are found for the selected date, the website shows a default message such as "No historical events found for this date."

This project is a fun, interactive way to explore the past and can be easily expanded to include a range of features or dynamic data through API integration.
